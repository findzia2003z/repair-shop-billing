# Final Solution: WinUI 3 App Distribution

## The Problem

WinUI 3 applications have a dependency on the Windows App Runtime that cannot be easily bundled in a traditional self-contained installer. The `WindowsAppSDKSelfContained=true` option doesn't work reliably with `dotnet publish`.

## The Solution: Use MSIX

MSIX is the **official and recommended** way to distribute WinUI 3 applications. It properly handles all dependencies including the Windows App Runtime.

### Why MSIX?

1. ✅ **Properly bundles Windows App Runtime**
2. ✅ **Handles all dependencies automatically**
3. ✅ **Clean installation and uninstallation**
4. ✅ **Automatic updates support**
5. ✅ **Works on Windows 10 1809+ and Windows 11**

## Quick Start: Create MSIX Package

### Step 1: Use Visual Studio (Easiest)

1. Open `RepairShopBilling.sln` in Visual Studio 2022
2. Right-click the project → **Publish** → **Create App Packages**
3. Select **Sideloading**
4. Choose **Yes, use the current certificate** (or create new)
5. Select platforms (x64 recommended)
6. Click **Create**

The MSIX package will be created in `AppPackages` folder.

### Step 2: Or Use PowerShell Script

```powershell
.\build-msix.ps1 -CreateCertificate -SignPackage -Configuration Release -Platform x64
```

## Installing the MSIX Package

### For Testing (Your Machine)

1. **Install the certificate** (first time only):
   - Right-click `RepairShopBilling_TemporaryKey.pfx`
   - Select **Install Certificate**
   - Choose **Local Machine**
   - Select **Place all certificates in the following store**
   - Browse to **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**
   - Click **OK**

2. **Install the app**:
   - Double-click the `.msixbundle` file
   - Click **Install**

### For Distribution to Users

#### Option 1: Self-Signed Certificate (Free, for internal use)

Users need to:
1. Install your certificate (one-time)
2. Install the MSIX package

**Pros**: Free, works immediately  
**Cons**: Users must manually trust your certificate

#### Option 2: Code Signing Certificate (Recommended for production)

Purchase a code signing certificate from:
- DigiCert (~$400/year)
- Sectigo (~$200/year)
- Other trusted CAs

**Pros**: Users don't need to install certificate, professional  
**Cons**: Costs money

## Alternative: Framework-Dependent with Runtime Installer

If you absolutely cannot use MSIX, you can:

1. Build framework-dependent (not self-contained)
2. Include runtime installers in your package
3. Install runtimes before running the app

### Required Runtimes

1. **.NET 8 Desktop Runtime**
   - Download: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0
   - File: `windowsdesktop-runtime-8.0.x-win-x64.exe`

2. **Windows App Runtime 1.4**
   - Download: https://aka.ms/windowsappsdk/1.4/latest/windowsappruntimeinstall-x64.exe

### Installation Script

```batch
REM Install .NET 8 Desktop Runtime
windowsdesktop-runtime-8.0-x64.exe /quiet /norestart

REM Install Windows App Runtime
windowsappruntimeinstall-x64.exe --quiet

REM Then copy your app files
xcopy /E /I /Y /Q "%~dp0app\*" "%ProgramFiles%\RepairShopBilling"
```

## Recommended Approach

### For Internal/Testing Use
Use **MSIX with self-signed certificate**:
1. Create MSIX package
2. Share certificate + MSIX with users
3. Users install certificate once, then install app

### For Production/External Distribution
Use **MSIX with code signing certificate**:
1. Purchase code signing certificate
2. Sign MSIX package
3. Distribute MSIX to users
4. Users just double-click and install (no certificate needed)

## Why Self-Contained Doesn't Work

WinUI 3 apps require:
1. .NET Runtime ✅ (can be bundled)
2. Windows App SDK Runtime ❌ (cannot be reliably bundled)

The Windows App SDK has native components and COM registrations that need proper installation. Simply copying DLLs doesn't work.

## Summary

**Best Solution**: Use MSIX packaging

**Quick Command**:
```powershell
.\build-msix.ps1 -CreateCertificate -SignPackage
```

**Result**: Professional installer that works correctly with all dependencies.
