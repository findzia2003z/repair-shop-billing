## The Error You Saw

error MSB4019: The imported project "Microsoft.DesktopBridge.props" was not found
```

## The Solution (30 Seconds)

Just run this:

test-build.bat
```

### 2. Test It Locally
```batch
cd installer
install.bat
```
(Run as administrator)

### 3. Create Distribution ZIP
```powershell
Compress-Archive -Path .\installer\* -DestinationPath RepairShopBilling.zip
```

### 4. Share with Users
Send them the ZIP file. They extract and run `install.bat` as administrator.
